# Unit Converter Web App

This is a simple web application for converting values between different units of measurement. It supports conversion for the following categories:
- Length (e.g., meter to kilometer)
- Weight (e.g., gram to kilogram)
- Temperature (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Flask

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask


## USAGE
Enter a value to convert.
Select the category (e.g., Length, Weight, Temperature).
Select the units to convert from and to.
Click the "Convert" button to get the result.

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me understand several important concepts and practices in web development and programming:

Setting Up a Flask Application: I learned how to set up a simple web server using Flask, which allowed me to create endpoints and handle requests and responses.
REST API Basics: This project required building a basic API to process conversion requests, which deepened my understanding of JSON handling and RESTful principles.
Unit Conversion Logic: Implementing the conversion logic required attention to detail with different units and their relations, reinforcing my problem-solving skills and mathematical knowledge.
JavaScript for Interactive Web Pages: On the front end, I used JavaScript to handle user inputs and make AJAX calls to the Flask server, improving my understanding of client-server communication.
HTML Form Handling and UI Updates: Structuring the user interface with HTML forms and dynamically updating the DOM gave me hands-on experience with front-end development.
